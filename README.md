libscene
========

Library originally meant to facilitate coding in both JSR184 (M3G) and OpenGL ES under Android (Java). Eventually, the project was re-scopped to only focus on a rendering-agnostic scenegraph.

LibScene depends on LibStrip and LibOldFart.

The idea of the library is to make it easy to setup the scene and its appearance in a way to make visibility processing easier. Just that and no more.

Planned featured:

    Multiple cameras
    Scene snapshot exporting
    Object hierarchy


"This will never happen":

    Animation
    Input system (this is the application's job)
    Sound (I'm planning yet another library to do just that)
